## About:
This is a class project to build a simplified e-commerce page.

The page contains a few products.  The product objects have a title, description, and price. It saves the product objects in a shopping cart with web storage.
The shopping cart icon shows how many items are in the cart. If you click on the cart icon the contents of the shopping cart are displayed on the bottom of the page.
